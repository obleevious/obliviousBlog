Dynamically || Statically vs Strongly || Weakly

Python is **Dynamically & Strongly** typed language

Dynamically || Statically typed:

In Dynamically typed language, a name bands to object only, you can band the same name to different objects with different types

In Statically type language, a name bands to both object and type at the time of declaration. Trying to band a different type will raise error.

Strongly || Weakly typed:

Strongly typed require implicit cast to operate on different types (except for related types, eg. integer & float)

Weakly typed allows operation between different types if it make sense.

eg. 9 + "9", "9".append(9)
